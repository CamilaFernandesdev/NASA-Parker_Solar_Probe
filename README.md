# HACKATHON: NASA SPACE APPS 
## Challenge: Creative Data Display with the Parker Solar Probe

Several spacecraft, including the Parker Solar Probe, are gathering data about the Sun that will enable us to learn more about solar effects (a.k.a. space weather) in space and on Earth. Your challenge is to create an interactive tool to represent this data in a new and inviting way that improves public knowledge and understanding of space weather.

## Objectives
Your challenge is to develop interactive and creative ways to improve public knowledge about the many spacecraft currently exploring the Sun, and help nonscientists interpret data from these missions using creative, user-friendly, and inviting methods. Think about how you can make this information accessible to the public so people around the world can see, hear, or feel how important it is. Let your creativity take you into the future!
## Potential Considerations
When responding to this challenge, you may (but are not required to) consider the following:

Your method could help people see, hear, or feel the information in creative ways by relying not only on visual means, but perhaps audio elements (especially for the visually impaired) and/or haptic (touch) surfaces as well. For instance, you could:

 - Create an online race car with an odometer and engine noise that corresponds to the speed of the solar wind or that changes colors to show the solar windâ€™s temperature
 - Code your Wi-Fi lighting to change colors during a live solar storm
- Create a tool that vibrates at different levels depending on the speed of the solar wind or intensity levels of the aurora
- Make music using different pitch, volume, and instruments to represent different particles or fields

As you develop your solution, you may (but are not required to) consider:

 - Including artistic elements such as drawing, painting, sculpture, 2D/3D design, music, written or spoken word, dance, textile, etc.
 - If you decide to create a physical tool, taking advantage of any available and accessible technologies such as 3D printers, paper, scissors, or glue
 - If you decide to create an online tool or application, making sure that it is user-friendly without the need for lengthy instructions
